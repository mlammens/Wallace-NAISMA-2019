## NAISMA 2019 - HOW TO USE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING TO STUDY THE PAST SPREAD AND PREDICT FUTURE SPREAD OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES - A WALLACE WORKSHOP

Distribution modeling is a mature tool for studying invasive species, but until recently has required quite a bit of computer programing techniques to implement best practices. This workshop will walk participants through the use of a new graphical user interface tool, named Wallace, to make learning about and building distribution models easier. Importantly, this tool makes use of citizen science data as part of the model input.
